Created heartbeat checker to check if ailanthus server is alive while the GUI app is running

Required outcomes
	if ailanthus still alive:
		do nothing
	if ailanthus is not alive:
		popup window and exit application

Problem #1:
	Heartbeat checker is a long surviving operation, meaning to say it cannot exist on the same thread as the GUI (tkinter) if not the GUI will freeze
Solution #1:
	Heartbeat checker needs to be on a thread by itself, on every check, provide a feedback indicating if a heartbeat is still there

To check the heartbeat status:
    1. Use queue and make:
        Heartbeat checker to push heartbeat status onto the queue
        GUI to poll for the status every x seconds and perform resulting actions
    2. Use a global variable shared between heartbeat checker thread and the GUI thread:
        Heartbeat checker to update variable every x seconds
        GUI to check this variable every X seconds and perform resulting actions
